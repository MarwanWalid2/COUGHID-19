# COUGHID-19

The project in hand is qualified to be deployed to the public and will solve the problem of COVID-19 detection and diagnosis, by creating an alternative method thatâ€™s effective and novel to combat the novel virus. After diffuse study and research, it can be concluded that the Coughid-19 will introduce a sensible and convenient A.I-based solution to solve the problem of the cost and inaccessiblity of PCR test.
Further, unlike ordinary solutions that require trained clinicians, high costs, or in personal visits, our solution was constructed so that anyone with no prior experience can operate it with ease and achieves high accuracy. In addition, the solution is user-friendly and can be used in a scalable manner. 

The project can be summarized as a website, which can be opened from any device, that can detect COVID-19 just by coughing.
